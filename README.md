# Arch Linux Hyprland Setup

This repo contains my setup for Arch Linux with the Hyprland Wayland compositor.

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
cp -r .config/hypr ~/.config/

# Fix USB/Bluetooth missing after suspend by resetting xHCI on resume 

## Summary

- **Symptom**: After suspend/resume, all USB devices and Bluetooth disappear until reboot.
- **Cause**: The USB 3.x host controller (xHCI) can get stuck after resume. Resetting the controller (unbind/bind) brings it back.
- **Scope**: GNOME/GDM, Hyprland, etc. Same root cause; not DE-specific. Common on Intel PCH xHCI at `0000:00:14.0`.

## What is xHCI?

- **xHCI** = eXtensible Host Controller Interface, the standard USB 3.x host controller used by modern chipsets.
- It manages most USB ports and often the internal Bluetooth device (which explains why both USB and BT die together).

## Find your xHCI PCI device ID

  ```bash
  lspci -nn | grep -i 'usb controller'
  ```

  Note: `lspci` prints `00:14.0`; prepend `0000:` to use with sysfs (`0000:00:14.0`).

## Quick test (manual reset)

Replace `0000:00:14.0` with your ID if different:

```bash
echo 0000:00:14.0 | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/drivers/xhci_hcd/unbind
sleep 1
echo 0000:00:14.0 | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/drivers/xhci_hcd/bind
```

If USB/BT return, proceed with the automatic fix below.

## Permanent fix: reset xHCI automatically on resume

Create a systemd sleep hook that runs after resume.

### Option 1: Auto-detect and reset all xHCI controllers (recommended)

**File**: `/etc/systemd/system-sleep/10-xhci-reset`
**Content**:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
case "$1/$2" in
  post/*)
    for devpath in /sys/bus/pci/drivers/xhci_hcd/*; do
      [ -e "$devpath" ] || continue
      dev=$(basename "$devpath")
      echo "$dev" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/xhci_hcd/unbind
      sleep 0.5
      echo "$dev" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/xhci_hcd/bind
    done
    ;;
esac
```

Then:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /etc/systemd/system-sleep/10-xhci-reset
```

### Option 2: Target a specific controller (e.g., Intel at `0000:00:14.0`)

**File**: `/etc/systemd/system-sleep/10-xhci-reset`
**Content**:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
case "$1/$2" in
  post/*)
    for dev in 0000:00:14.0 0000:00:0d.0; do
      [ -e "/sys/bus/pci/devices/$dev" ] || continue
      echo "$dev" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/xhci_hcd/unbind
      sleep 0.5
      echo "$dev" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/xhci_hcd/bind
    done
    ;;
esac
```

Then:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /etc/systemd/system-sleep/10-xhci-reset
```

## Verify

Suspend and resume:

```bash
systemctl suspend
```

After resume, USB devices and Bluetooth should work immediately.
You can confirm with:

```bash
lsusb
systemctl status bluetooth
```

# gnome as alternative (GDM to switch )
```bash
sudo pacman -S gdm
sudo systemctl enable --now gdm
sudo pacman -S gnome-control-center gnome-bluetooth chrome-gnome-shell gnome-tweaks
```

GNOME on Wayland cannot be restarted with Alt+F2 â†’ r; log out and log back in instead.

if an issue occured and gnome is forzen, switch to another tty
Ctrl + Alt + F2 for tty2 ..

to restart gdm 
```bash
sudo systemctl restart gdm
```
